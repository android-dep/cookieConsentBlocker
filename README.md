# CookieConsentBlocker
A list of cookie consent elements on web pages to block in uBlock

This is a list of the different cookie consent elements found on various sites that prompt you to accept their cookie consent to collect your information

The idea is that many of these elements many be used on other sites as well so if you block the element by name across all sites, it will(or at least theoretically) reduce the amount of cookie consent popups you see whenever browsing the internet on new pages.
